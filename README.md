### Project Overview

This project aims to assess the impact of remote work on employees' mental health, focusing on key areas such as stress levels, social isolation, and job satisfaction. By analyzing these factors across various demographics and work locations (remote, hybrid, onsite), the study seeks to reveal patterns that can inform better support strategies. The insights gathered will guide recommendations for organizations, helping them to implement policies and resources that enhance mental well-being, foster a healthier work-life balance, and create a supportive work environment for remote employees.

### Data Source

Remote Work & Mental Health Data: The primary Data set used for this analysis is the "Imapct_of_Remote_Work_on_Mental_Health.csv", file, containing information
about the Impact of remote work on mental health from Kaggle.com.

## Tools
- Excel- Data cleaning
- SQL - Data Analysis
- Tableau - Visualisation 

### Data Cleaning/Preperation

Duplicate Removal: To maintain data integrity, I checked the dataset for duplicate values within the "Employee_ID" column and removed any duplicates found.

Blank Cell Verification: I thoroughly inspected the dataset for blank cells in each column to ensure completeness, confirming that there were no missing values.

Spell Check: I utilized Excel's spell check function to verify correct spelling throughout the dataset, ensuring clarity and professionalism in all text fields.

Data Validation: I applied data validation to the "Work_Location" column to restrict entries to "Onsite," "Remote," and "Hybrid," preventing any inconsistent values.

Data Structuring: I organized the dataset into an Excel table format, improving readability and enabling more efficient data manipulation.

Find and Replace: I used the "Find and Replace" function to identify and correct any inconsistencies or unintended data entries, ensuring accurate, standardized information across all columns.

Overall, while the dataset was relatively clean initially, I applied these steps to verify its accuracy, completeness, and proper formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

How does work location (remote, hybrid, onsite) influence stress levels?

What is the relationship between social isolation and job satisfaction?

Are there demographic trends in mental health conditions?

Does access to mental health resources vary by work location, and how does this impact stress levels?
